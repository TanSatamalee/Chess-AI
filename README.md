# Chess AI Testing Grounds

Pulled repo of chessboard from [chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com) and created an AI using min-max algorithms along with a few others to test how AI algorithms worked. The script runs relatively slowly depending on the algorithm, so some optimization might be needed to make it playable.
